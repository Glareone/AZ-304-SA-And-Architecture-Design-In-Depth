## Questions upfront
* Can we leverage the existing cloud infrastructure from Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, or we are focusing on inventing them by ourselves?
  - We could expect to hear that we can leverage, because it's unrealistic for most of the companies.
* Cost optimization on CDN level
  - Definitely worth to discuss because it costs a lot.

## Functiona moments and Requirements
* Video uploading flow
  - (Optional) Recommendation system based on your preferences (immediate changes, scheduled changes)
  - bitrates & transcoding questions

* Video streaming flow
  - (Optional) Prepared set of 100 videos on the main screen
  - (Optional) Offline streaming?
  - Switching between bitrate for smooth user experience?

## Non-Functional Requirements
* Ability to upload videos fast
* Smooth video streaming
* Ability to change video quality
* Low infrastructure cost
* High availability, scalability, and reliability requirements
* Clients supported: mobile apps, web browser, and smart TV

## DAU & Costs
* Assume the product has 5 million daily active users (DAU).
* Users watch 5 videos per day.
* 10% of users upload 1 video per day.
* Assume the average video size is 300 MB.
* Total daily storage space needed: 5 million * 10% * 300 MB = 150TB
* CDN cost.
* When cloud CDN serves a video, you are charged for data transferred out of the

### CDN. Discussing how to reduce the cost of CDN might be very important on the interview
* Let us use Amazon’s CDN CloudFront for cost estimation. Assume 100% of traffic is served from the United States. The average cost per GB is $0.02.
For simplicity, we only calculate the cost of video streaming.
* 5 million * 5 videos * 0.3GB * $0.02 = $150,000 per day.

## High Level Design

* CDN and blob storage are the cloud services we will leverage.

## Video Uploading Flow

* Load balancer: A load balancer evenly distributes requests among API servers.
* API servers: All user requests go through API servers except video streaming.
* Metadata DB: Video metadata are stored in Metadata DB. It is sharded and replicated to
meet performance and high availability requirements.
* Metadata cache: For better performance, video metadata and user objects are cached.
* Original storage: A blob storage system is used to store original videos. A quotation in
Wikipedia regarding blob storage shows that: “A Binary Large Object (BLOB) is a
collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system” [6].
* Transcoding servers: Video transcoding is also called video encoding. It is the process of
converting a video format to other formats (MPEG, HLS, etc), which provide the best
video streams possible for different devices and bandwidth capabilities.
* Transcoded storage: It is a blob storage that stores transcoded video files.
* CDN: Videos are cached in CDN. When you click the play button, a video is streamed
from the CDN.
* Completion queue: It is a message queue that stores information about video transcoding
completion events.
* Completion handler: This consists of a list of workers that pull event data from the
completion queue and update metadata cache and database.

### Video Uploading Flow. Transcoding
Transcoding is computationally expensive and time-consuming.  
Meta uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) programming model which defines tasks in stages so they can be executed parallelly or sequentially.

* Inspection: Make sure videos have good quality and are not malformed.
* Video encodings: Videos are converted to support different resolutions, codec, bitrates, etc. Figure 14-9 shows an example of video encoded files.
* Thumbnail. Thumbnails can either be uploaded by a user or automatically generated by the system.
* Watermark: An image overlay on top of your video contains identifying information about your video

### Transcoding Architecture

## Video Streaming
**Protocols**
* MPEG-DASH "Moving Picture Experts Group" - "Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP"
* Apple HLS. "Http Live Streaming"
* Microsoft Smooth Streaming
* Adobe Http Dynamic Streaming (HDS)

Recommendation: They all support different video encodings. You have to choose the right streaming protocol for your business case.
